let details:[String, number, boolean]=["Sudhanshu",8115830551,true];
// in this details array ke have to assign a value in specific order eitherwise they provide error

// PROBLEM IN TUPLES

// in tuples we can break this by using an datatype using push(), shift() etc.

details.unshift(67); // they add 67 in 0 index of array byt according to tuple they accept string i used string in that palce
